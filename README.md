# COMP1721 Practical Work

This repository contains my exercise and coursework solutions for [COMP1721 Object-Oriented Programming](https://comp1721.info).

Exercises:
1) A Basic Java Program:
    - Converts a weight in kilograms to pounds and ounces.
    - MARKS: 3/3.
2) Math Class and Formatted Output:
    - Calculates the eccentricity and and volume of a spheroid given its equatorial and polar radii.
    - MARKS: 2/2.
3) Conditional Statements:
    - Modify Ex2 to include error messages if the given values are out of range.
    - MARKS: 3/3.
4) String Handling and The Command Line:
    - Checks whether a given password is valid given a set of conditions.
    - MARKS: 5/5.
5) Arrays and Loops:
    - Calculates the arithmetic mean of a set of numbers, given by the user.
    - MARKS: 3/3.
6) A Small Class:
    - Create a Circle class that calculates the areaa and perimeter of a circle given its radius.
    - Create another class called CircleDemo that calls the Circle class and its methods.
    - MARKS: 4/4.
7) More Features of Classes:
    - Modify the Circle class from Ex6 to overload thE constructor with a default version, throw an instance of IllegalArgumentException if the given radius value <= 0, override the default toString() method with a new one, and override the default equals() method so it will return true if the radii of two different Circle objects differ by less than 0.00005.
    - Modify the CircleDemo class to include the toString() and equals() methods.
    - MARKS: 4/4.
8) ArrayList and Reading From Files:
    - Create a class called Dataset that contains the data in an ArrayList, and has two methods: size() to calculate the size of the dataset, and meanValue() to calculate the mean of the values in the dataset.
    - Use ComputeMean.java and data.txt to read the data from the text file and call the Dataset class and its methods.
    - MARKS: 4/4.
9) Inheritance:
    - Create a class called AlarmClock that inherits from Clock.java, a given class, and adds new methods: isRinging() and display() methods.
    - Use AlarmTest.java to test the AlarmClock class methods.
    - MARKS: 4/4.
10) Interfaces:
    - Copy the Circle class from Ex6 and modify it and a given class, Money.java, so they inherit from an Interface called Writeable, and both contain a method called writeTo().
    - Use Ex10.java to test whether the methods works.
    - MARKS: 3/3.
